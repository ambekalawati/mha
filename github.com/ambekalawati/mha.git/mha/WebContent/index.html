					<h5>
						<strong>MISSION</strong>
					</h5>
					<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the most recent data, approximately 808 women
						die every day from preventable causes related to pregnancy and
						childbirth. This is about one woman every two minutes. For every
						woman who dies, an estimated 20 or 30 encounter injuries,
						infections or disabilities. Most of these deaths and injuries are
						entirely preventable. Making motherhood safer is a human rights
						imperative, and it is at the core of<strong> MATERNAL HEALTH AWARNESS.</strong> Our
						mission is to deliver a world where every pregnancy is wanted,
						every childbirth is safe and every young person's potential is
						fulfilled. Prevention of teen pregnancies, complications of which
						are the leading cause of death for girls 15-19 years old. Delivery
						of safe birth supplies, dignity kits and other life-saving
						materials to survivors of conflict and natural disaster.</p>
				
				
					<h5 class="body">
						<strong>7 FACTS ABOUT MATERNAL HEALTH YOU SHOULD KNOW</strong>
					</h5>
					<p style="text-align:justify;">Although we can send a rover to Mars, more than 300,000
						women died in 2015 of complications from pregnancy and childbirth
						– complications that were mostly preventable. It’s simple: No
						woman should die from giving birth. No matter where mothers live,
						the United Nations is committed to improving maternal health
						because it is a fundamental human right and a crucial development
						issue that is part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
						which sets a target to reduce maternal deaths by 2030. Stronger
						maternal health is essential to reducing poverty (SDG 1), ensuring
						healthy lives (SDG 3), achieving gender equality (SDG 5), and
						underpins many other global goals.UN agencies work around the
						world to support mothers. Outside a rural town in Laos, a mother
						travels by motorbike to an integrated health services clinic
						supported by the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) to receive a
						lifesaving vaccine for maternal and neonatal tetanus.</P>
					<h5>
						<strong>1. Since 1990, the world reduced maternal deaths
							by 44%.</strong>
					</h5>
					<p style="text-align:justify;">While maternal health has advanced in almost every region –
						primarily from increased access to family planning and skilled
						health care workers – levels of maternal mortality remain
						unacceptably high in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. These two
						regions account for 88% of maternal deaths worldwide. At the same
						time, even in countries that have made big progress, many are
						still grappling with stark inequalities – especially for women
						living in poverty.</p>
					<h5>
						<strong>2. Around 303,000 girls and women die every year
							– that’s 830 every day– from preventable causes related to
							pregnancy and childbirth.</strong>
					</h5>
					<p style="text-align:justify;">WHO estimates that 99% of these deaths occur in developing
						countries. However, we have solutions: Most maternal deaths can be
						prevented if pregnancies are attended by skilled health care
						workers – doctors, nurses, or midwives – before, during, and after
						childbirth. Additionally, access to proper equipment, supplies,
						reliable energy helps improve health.</p>
					<h5>
						<strong>3. Complications during pregnancy and childbirth
							are the leading cause of death for girls ages 15 to 19 globally.</strong>
					</h5>
					<p style="text-align:justify;">WHO estimates that 95%of the world’s births to adolescents
						occur in developing countries. For many young mothers, pregnancies
						are neither planned nor wanted and could be prevented with access
						to contraception.</p>
					<h5>
						<strong>4. More than 500 women and girls in emergency
							situations die every day from complications due to pregnancy and
							childbirth.</strong>
					</h5>
					<p style="text-align:justify;">Conflict, natural disasters, and displacement amplify risks
						for everyone, but especially for millions of girls and women who
						are already vulnerable. When crises unfold, women and girls may
						lose access to family planning and other essential health
						services, face unintended pregnancies, and become far more
						vulnerable to sexual violence and HIV.</p>
					<h5>
						<strong>5. In 2017, UNFPA humanitarian assistance reached
							10.8 million people with sexual and reproductive health services
							in 53 countries.</strong>
					</h5>
					<p style="text-align:justify;">MHA is often the first – and in some cases the only – health
						provider protecting and assisting girls and women affected by
						crises. By providing complete guidline</p>
					<h5>
						<strong>6. Fulfilling the unmet need for family planning
							and providing quality maternal and newborn care would reduce
							maternal deaths by 73%.</strong>
					</h5>
					<p style="text-align:justify;">oday, 214 million girls and women around the world want to
						avoid pregnancy, but are not using modern contraceptives. Access
						to modern contraception and maternal and newborn health care are
						critical to enabling women to have the number of children they
						want, to time births as they desire, and to deliver their healthy
						babies safely.</p>
					<h5>
						<strong>7. Thanks to global immunization efforts,
							maternal and neonatal tetanus is endemic only in 15 countries.</strong>
					</h5>
					<p style="text-align:justify;">In 1999, 59 countries had not eliminated maternal and
						neonatal tetanus. Though the disease is painful and can be lethal
						without proper care, an inexpensive vaccine can stop it. UNICEF
						has immunized over 151 million women in 53 countries to eliminate
						the disease in more than three dozen countries.</p>
