    <h5 class="card-title">First Month</h5>
    <h4>1st Month of Pregnancy - Symptoms, Bodily Changes & Diet:-</h4>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Pregnancy is one of the most exciting phases of one's life
and is divided into three trimesters. 
You would see some distinct changes in every trimester of pregnancy. 
However, the first trimester is considered to be most delicate and critical phase of pregnancy. 
And, the scientific reason behind it is that the foetus is yet to get attached to the mother's body via the placenta.
Hence, the body keeps undergoing dramatic changes to make way for placental development by the end of the third month.
You would be surprised to know that most women don't get to know of their pregnancy until three to four weeks...</p>
<h4>THE FIRST MONTH OF PREGNANCY IS CRITICAL, AND YOU NEED TO TAKE THE FOLLOWING PRECAUTIONS:</h4>

<h5>1. CAFFEINE INTAKE:</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caffeine in the form of tea, coffee or chocolates is harmful during pregnancy. 
Excessive caffeine intake during pregnancy can lead to premature birth or can also induce birth defects.
However, small amounts of tea or coffee intake in a day is considered safe. 
High caffeine intake in the form of tea or coffee can also lead to acidity or nausea sensation in the body.
</p>
<h5>2. SAUNA BATH OR HOT STEAM BATH:</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The body temperature is already high inside due to higher metabolic rate during pregnancy. 
Hence, body treatments requiring exposure to high heat can lead to excessive sweating and make you uncomfortable.
</p>
<h5>3. SMOKING AND LIQUOR:</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Smoking is highly dangerous for the baby inside. 
It may pose serious health risks to the foetus and can also lead to premature birth.
With tobacco consumption, the risk of getting cancer also increases much fold in both the foetus and mother. 
Also, liquor consumption should be stopped soon after realizing that you are pregnant.
The liquor consumed will travel via blood to the foetus which is seriously harmful 
and it also puts an extra burden on your liver which is already working hard to purify your body. 
Liquor consumption may slow down the growth of the foetus.</p>
<h5>4. MEDICATIONS:</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you are on any medications, then you need to consult your doctor immediately. 
Any allopathic or herbal medications need to be approved by your doctor during pregnancy.
Normally, expecting mom is never put through any medications unless she is severely ill.
</p>
<h5>5. SEAFOOD:</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Seafood may contain a higher amount of toxic metals such as mercury or other heavy metals. 
The sea water contamination is posing serious health hazards to the consumers.
But, you may consume freshwater fishes in a small amount, as it is, 
freshwater fishes are considered to be safe and are rich in fat and protein.
</p>
<h5>6. FATIGUE:</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You will get tired frequently and easily with regular household chores. 
You have to take frequent rest to overcome fatigue. 
You may also feel sleepy through the day due to tiredness. 
Your body is getting prepared to manufacture a small baby inside so all your 
energies are used in helping the baby grow rapidly within your womb.
</p>
<h5>7. FREQUENT URINATION:</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Make sure you empty your bladder frequently as you would have a sensation of frequent urination. 
The blood supply to all the organs is increased during pregnancy including bladder. 
And, as the foetus grows the uterus presses the bladder, giving you a sensation of frequent urination.
Make sure when you step out, you have access to clean hygienic toilets.
</p>
<h5>8. FREQUENT WATER INTAKE:</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the coming weeks of pregnancy, the blood gets diluted to be able to quickly reach the foetus via the placenta. 
In the first few weeks, you may experience constipation too, so it is advised to drink plenty of water.
Also, the amniotic fluid in the uterus contains mainly water, so adequate water intake is really helpful in pregnancy.
</p>
<h5>9. LIFTING ANYTHING HEAVY:</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The foetus inside your womb is too delicate and resides in a pit on the uterine wall. 
If you lift anything heavy, it may put a strain on the foetus.
Also, you may get back pain in lifting heavy things as the back is already bearing the weight of the baby.
<h4>1) Diet:-</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Eat a healthy and balanced diet for adequate foetal development. 
You don't have to eat for two as it was believed before in olden days. 
Lot of vegetables, fruits, protein, healthy fats is what you need. 
Folic acid rich foods, Vitamin D, Iodine help to reduce any birth defects in the second month of pregnancy. 
You must have heard from your mother to avoid some foods like papaya, jack fruit, and pineapple during pregnancy.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are totally right. 
Avoid Contraction-Inducing Foods like pineapple, raw papaya, Seafood, Processed Foods, frozen foods etc.
 Do not overeat, even if it is your favorite food. 
Eat a lot of fiber rich foods as they can help you with bloating and constipation problems. 
Take 2nd month pregnancy care as eating and pregnancy go hand in hand.
</p>
 <h4>2) Get some regular exercise:-</h4>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">Join in a special prenatal yoga classes for moms to be. 
Remember to take precautions in pregnancy by consulting your gynac before you decide to do any physical activity as exercise. 
Avoid doing stressful exercises that will strain you. 
Walking is one of the best exercises as it helps ease or prevent pain and boost energy levels.
</p>
 <p>It is also believed that a physically active woman during pregnancy has to suffer less labour pain and delivery is smooth. 
Exercise at a moderate level and stop if you are tired.
</p>
 <h4>3) Drink more water:-</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">This is another important pregnancy precautions. 
You should drink 2-3 litres of water every day. Stay hydrated so that your body will not get undernourished. 
If you have dry skin and hands problem than drinking water is the best thing you can do.
</p>
 <h4>4) Yeast infection:-</h4>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Vaginal yeast infection is a common 1st month pregnancy symptom in expecting mommies. 
You must take necessary precautions during early pregnancy to maintain hygienic conditions in vagina. 
This occurs due changed hormonal levels and glycogen content in secretions. Also taking probiotic supplements can help.
</p>
<h4>5) Do not bend and lift weights:-
</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">There are many pregnancy precautions told to us by doctors. 
One of the common precautions during pregnancy is to avoid carrying things that weigh more than 10 kgs. 
This limit will reduce as your pregnancy proceeds. Lifting heavy weights can stress the 
abdomen while doing household works and create problems. 
Also bending excessively while doing any household chores can cause dizziness. Prefer to squat instead of bending.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
These were some of the precautions that need to be taken in the first month of pregnancy. 
Also, there are a lot of concerns and mood swings that come your way during pregnancy. 
You must read a lot of positive stuff and reach out to people who have had the experience of becoming moms.

Pregnancy is a wonderful journey which amazes you with the power of nature to create new life. 
You should be grateful that nature has chosen you to give birth to a new life. 
The sooner you make peace with this new development and feels excited about it, the easier it gets to becoming a mom.

</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">->  As mentioned above, 
2 month pregnant women don't actually look pregnant but their uterus already has started expanding 
and they show maximum 2nd month pregnancy symptoms. This expansion puts pressure on the bladder thereby making

growing and the embryo starts looking much closer to a miniature baby. There is no way you can guess whether 
it's a boy or girl in 2nd month.
</p>

will not increase in size but uterus will become size of an apple though hidden within pelvis.

 <p style="text-align:justify;">Nausea and vomiting could peak by the third month. 
Most pregnant women are relieved of these symptoms by the end of the first trimester.
</p>
 <h4>2. Fatigue:</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">Pregnancy hormones make you feel tired and drowsy. 
The body needs extra blood to supply essential nutrients to the foetus, thereby affecting blood sugar and pressure levels.
</p>
 <h4>3. Loss of Bladder Control:</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">Increased formation of urine, as well as the pressure exerted on the bladder by the growing uterus,
 can cause a greater urge to urinate often.
</p>
 <h4>4. Constipation:</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">Higher progesterone levels slow down the digestion process.</p>
 <h4>5. Vaginal Discharge:</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">High oestrogen levels and the dilation of the cervix and vaginal walls result in an off-white
 or translucent mucous discharge from the vagina, which prevents any infection from passing into the uterus.
</p>
 <h4>6. Leg Cramps:</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">Severe leg cramps and pain may be common during the night. 
You may need to include potassium and iron in your diet, and some gentle exercises could also help to reduce discomfort.

The pressure on the stomach causes the acids to move upwards, causing heartburn. Eat at regular times and try eating small meals.
</p>
 <h4>11. Varicose Veins:</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">As the uterus expands, it compresses the blood vessels and slows down the circulation of blood.

first three months of your journey into motherhood. As you enter the fourth month, here are some symptoms you may notice.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">->Some women experience haemorrhoids due to the pressure created by the growing baby on the rectal veins,
    which can be very painful.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">->Bleeding gums occurs in many pregnant women due to the increase in pregnancy hormones, 
which makes your gums softer and more sensitive. 
It is the reason why you may brush your teeth and see a little bleeding. This symptom usually disappears after pregnancy.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">->You can expect to run to the washroom quite often, 
    as there will be pressure on the bladder, leading to frequent urination.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">->Some women experience shortness of breath due to the 4-month-foetus in the womb.

surrounding environment and organs.

This is mainly due to the fact that digestion slows down during pregnancy, 
leading to heartburn.

 <p style="text-align:justify;">->Do not have too much caffeine, as it can increase your baby's heart rate.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">->If you have pets like cats, do not clean the cat litter, as you could contract a parasite from the litter.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">->Do not sit in a hot tub or a sauna, as the high heat environment can cause complications in pregnancy.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">->Avoid eating meat cooked outside, as you do not know if it is cleaned and cooked properly.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">->Don't drink alcohol, as the foetus can develop fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">->Do not smoke, as expectant mothers who smoke can deliver babies with low birth weight and are at a greater risk of disabilities.
</p>
 <h4>Diet:-</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">Iron, calcium and folic acid are extremely important for pregnant women. 
Since the mother is eating for two, she shouldn't worry about weight gain, 
as long as the food is healthy and nutritious. 
It is also important to talk to your gynaecologist and take any supplements necessary, 
such as Vitamin D, to keep your vitals up. 
Food should typically be home-cooked to keep it hygienic and can include grains, 
fruits and vegetables. Food that is rich in protein, like fish and chicken, can also be consumed. 
Every meal should include all the three things mentioned above to ensure optimal foetal development.
</p>
 <h4>Tests and Checkups Recommended in the Fourth-Month of Pregnancy:-</h4>
 <h6>->A Physical Check-Up-</h6>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">Your gynaecologist will physically check parts such as the vagina, breasts and abdomen.
</p>
 <h6>->4th-Month Pregnancy Scan-</h6>
 <p style="text-align:justify;"> An ultrasound will be conducted to see the changes to foetal development.
</p>
 <h6>->Fetal Heartbeat- </h6>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">Your doctor will check if the baby's heartbeat is too slow or too fast using a Doppler Ultrasound.
</p>
 <h6>->Edema Test-</h6>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">Your doc will check for swelling in the legs, ankles and feet. Abnormal swelling may indicate preeclampsia, 
gestational diabetes, or a blood clot.

    <h5 class="card-title">Fifth Month</h5>
    <h4>5th Month of Pregnancy - Symptoms, Bodily Changes & Diet:-</h4>
    <h5>Symptoms in the Fifth Month:-</h5>
    <p>By the fifth month, the pregnancy symptoms reduce. In this month, you'll experience:
</p>
 <h4>1. Baby Movements:-</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">First-time mothers may not be able to feel their baby's movements to a great extent. 
Experienced moms are more aware of the movements.
</p>
 <h4>2. Heartburn:-</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">Heartburn is a symptom that lasts throughout pregnancy. 
As the baby grows, he may need more room for himself and can start exerting pressure on the internal organs 
forcing contents to move back into the oesophagus. Also, the muscles separating the oesophagus and the 
stomach tend to relax letting the stomach acid penetrate into the oesophagus causing heartburn.
</p>
 <h4>3. Breast Enlargement:-</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">The breasts become bigger and start generating colostrum - 
a yellowish secretion which is the first milk, also called the foremilk. Unlike breast milk, it may not flow freely.
Usually, the breasts may express some drops.
</p>
 <h4>4. Skin Pigmentation:-
</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">Fluctuating pregnancy hormones can lead to increased melanin production triggering darkening of 
the skin at various places in many pregnant women. The skin typically darkens around the forehead, cheeks, 
and nose in the form of a mask. Such a condition is colloquially called mask of pregnancy.
</p>
 <h4>5. Increase in Appetite:-</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">Most pregnant women experience an increase in appetite in the fifth month. 
You may also develop food cravings and aversion for certain foods.
</p>
 <h4>6. High Blood Pressure:-</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">Some women develop gestational hypertension while pregnant, resulting in high blood pressure.

</p>
 <h4>Concerns in the Fifth Month of Pregnancy:-</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">A few women experience discomfort in the fifth month of pregnancy. It can take the form of:
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">-Abdominal pain</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">-Leg cramps</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">-Swollen ankles and feet</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">-Backache, especially in the lower back</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">-Increase in the pulse rate</p>

 <p style="text-align:justify;">-Acute cystitis (inflamed bladder)</p>
 <h4>Baby Development at 5 Months-:</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">By this stage, the growth of the baby happens rapidly. Your baby crown-rump length (CRL) is 13 - 25.6 cm, and weight is
 between 140 and 300 grams. The developmental milestones that your baby goes through in the fifth month are:
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">-Your baby's skin gets coated in a thick, creamy and protective covering called the vernix. 
It protects his fragile skin from the amniotic fluid.</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">-Your baby's muscles and bones become denser, and his hands, legs, fingers and toes become well-defined.</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">-His eyebrows, eyelids, eyelashes, hair, ears, and nails start forming.</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">-Your baby can stretch, open his eyes a bit, yawn, suck on his thumb, kick and move around.</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">-He can also twist and turn around.</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">- The baby's tiny features can make facial expressions.</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">-His schedule consists of sleeping and waking.</p>

 <P style="text-align:justify;">-He also develops genitals at this stage.</P>
 <P style="text-align:justify;">-Your baby starts hearing sounds. Therefore, outside noises can disturb him.</P>
 <P style="text-align:justify;">-His brain develops further.</P>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">-By the 18th week, your little one's immune system also develops.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">-By the 20th week, the nervous system starts to function. The endocrine glands and the spleen start performing their roles.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">-Your baby may assume the head-down position.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">-He develops sensitivity to light.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">-He also starts forming taste buds. A 5-month-old unborn baby may be able to sense the difference between salty and sweet
</p>
  <h4>Do's and Don'ts in the Fifth Month:-</h4>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">To reduce your discomfort and avoid pregnancy complications, follow these dos and don’ts:
</p>
  <h4>Do's-</h4>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">1.  Increase the Intake of Vitamin C
Incorporate foods like broccoli, oranges, and tomatoes into your 5-month pregnancy diet for vitamin C.
</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">4. Avoid Sitting/Standing for Long Hours
To improve blood circulation and avoid cramps and aches, refrain from sitting or standing for long. 
Get up and move around at regular intervals.
</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">5. Adopt a Comfortable Sleeping Position
The expanding belly makes certain sleeping positions uncomfortable. 
Try and sleep to your left side. A pregnancy pillow between the legs can provide comfort.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">6. Take Rest
Taking adequate rest and sleeping well during pregnancy is essential to reduce pregnancy-related stress and fatigue. 
If you can’t sleep for long hours, take power naps.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">8. Adopt a Comfortable Sleeping Position
The expanding belly makes certain sleeping positions uncomfortable. 
Try and sleep to your left side. A pregnancy pillow between the legs can provide comfort.

  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Sixth Month</h5>
    <h4>6th Month of Pregnancy - Symptoms, Bodily Changes & Diet:-</h4>
    <h5>Common 6th Month Pregnancy Symptoms:-</h5>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">Here are some of the common symptoms at 6 months.</p>
    <h4>1. Constipation and Indigestion-</h4>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">Most women experience constipation along with heartburn throughout pregnancy. 
The cause for the same differs at different stages of pregnancy. 
Constipation experienced at the early stages of pregnancy is due to the changes in hormones, 
which slows down digestion due to loosening of the muscles around the bowel. As the months pass by, 
the enlargement of the uterus puts pressure on the bowels, 
leading to indigestion. Other reasons include taking multivitamin pills, which, again, tighten the stool, 
causing discomfort and bloating. In order to control the situation, you can exercise regularly, drink plenty of water, 
juices and other fluids and consume fibre-rich foods. Curd works wonderfully well in reducing constipation and indigestion. 
If you face extreme discomfort, speak to your doctor for laxatives.
</p>
    <h4>2. Oedema-</h4>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">As you enter your last trimester you will experience swelling in your feet, ankles, 
and sometimes hands, too! 
As your body is preparing for the baby, 
it retains fluid in the tissues to nourish you and the baby, which causes this swelling. 
A bit of swelling around the eyes and cheeks is also normal, but if the swelling is accompanied with high protein levels, 
then it might be a sign of preeclampsia – a serious medical condition that causes blood pressure spikes. 
In order to avoid oedema try to keep your legs up whenever possible and avoid wearing tight clothes. 
Try not to stand for long periods.</p>
      <h4>3. Hunger Cravings and Increased Appetite-</h4>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">At this stage, you are not just eating for yourself, but also for your baby. 
The baby’s organs are developing, so your body needs to supply increased nutrients and vitamins. 
This is the reason why you will feel sudden hunger pangs and increased appetite around this time. 
So, it's better to satisfy your urge without feeling guilty, but, at the same time, eat wisely. 
Choose healthy food options like fruits, salads, and whole-grain foods over junk foods. 
Drink plenty of water and have six to seven small portions of meals a day instead of three large ones.
</p>
    <h4>4. Snoring-</h4>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">Many ladies experience snoring at this stage of pregnancy. 
Again, blame it on the pregnancy hormones. 
The weight gain causes your neck and head tissues to swell, leading to snoring, and additionally, 
your mucous membrane also swells. It's better to use nasal strips while sleeping for better breathing. 
Snoring might also be an indication of gestational diabetes, which can be monitored through blood and urine tests.
</p>
 <h4>5. Backache-</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">Experienced by most of the ladies, backache starts from your initial stages of pregnancy and goes on till delivery; 
many times continues even after delivery! The weight gain causes a backache, and also, as the uterus grows, 
it causes your lower back to curve. The relaxin hormone loosens your pelvic muscles to prepare the body for delivery, 
which again triggers a backache. Try to maintain a good posture while sitting and keep your legs up whenever possible.
</p>
 <h4>Body Changes During the Sixth Month of Pregnancy-:</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">As mentioned earlier, now you finally look pregnant. 
Your six months pregnant belly will start showing. 
By now your body will also gain weight, and as the uterus pushes the abdomen, 
your belly button will also protrude and remain this way until a few weeks post-delivery. 
Due to the weight of the baby and the growing uterus, you might experience dizziness and light-headedness at times.

</p>
 <h4>What Are Some Common Concerns in the Sixth Month of Pregnancy?</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">1. Itchiness Around the Abdomen
Around the middle of the 6th month of your pregnancy, you will experience itchiness around the abdomen. 
This happens because your baby is almost developed and your skin starts stretching to accommodate the growing foetus and 
enlarged uterus. As a result, your skin becomes dry and starts itching. 
This is the perfect time to apply those creams and ointments for stretch marks to retain the moisture in your skin 
and reduce itchiness. Also, keep drinking lots of water to keep your skin hydrated.</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">2. Backache and Body Ache
Along with a backache, body ache will also start bugging you. 
You will feel more tired with each passing day. As the uterus grows, 
the ligaments from the pelvic area to the abdomen are stretched and put under extreme pressure, 
which causes lower tummy pain. The pain might continue for a few hours, but you must consult a doctor if it lasts for long 
and is followed by contractions.</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">3. Sleepless Nights
Most of the ladies experience insomnia around this time of the pregnancy, 
the reasons being hormonal changes, frequent visits to the washroom at night, 
and heartburn or indigestion. Moreover, when the baby kicks and flutters in the middle of the night, 
it's obvious you might not be able to have a good night sleep. Some tips to avoid insomnia are to have your dinner 2-3 hours 
before bedtime and also be careful about what you eat. Secondly, follow a bedtime ritual like a relaxing breathing yoga, reading, 
listening to music, a warm water bath, etc. Sleep on a comfortable bed and correct room temperature.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">4. Varicose Veins
Varicose veins are more or less hereditary and caused because the veins have to push extra blood to your uterus to meet 
the nutritional requirements of the growing baby. These veins, which look swollen and purple in colour around your 
thighs and under the knee area, are known as varicose veins. Exercise regularly and try to keep your feet up whenever possible.
 Also, wear comfortable innerwear and shoes.
</p>
<h4>Baby Development at the 6th Month of Pregnancy-</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">A 6-month-old baby in the womb is almost fully grown and getting stronger day by day. 
His organs are still growing and lungs are not completely developed. 
As the baby's skin and muscles get matured, you can experience the baby's movements in the form of kicks and squirms. 
Along with his weight increasing, he also grows in length and is now about a foot long. He starts reacting to sound. 
You can determine the foetus' position with an ultrasound and see that the face of the baby is developed and the head is in 
proportion to the body. He can even sense light and darkness by this time, and also starts developing white blood cells to 
fight against diseases. The face of the baby would be complete by now including his eyelashes, eyebrows, and hair. 
The growth of hair depends upon genetics and some babies are born with a lot of hair while some are totally bald.
</p>
 <h4>6th-Month-Pregnancy Diet-</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">It is better to avoid junk food and stick to cleanly cooked home-made stuff. 
Ensure that a continuous supply of folic acid, iron and calcium is being taken, 
as the baby needs nutrients to develop completely. 6th month of pregnancy food includes green leafy vegetables, 
nuts, fruits, and whole-grain foods in your diet for a steady flow of nutrients and minerals. Fruits like apricot, 
cherries, guava, grapes, berries, apple, mango, pineapple, etc.

The baby's brain development is at its peak at this point in time. Hence, you will notice that he is more sensitive to 
sound, music, and smell.
Your baby will move often in your tummy.
The baby's hearing has developed more. This is the best time to connect with him through sounds. You can talk or sing to him.
The baby's body is almost fully developed by now. The fat accumulation will start from the beginning of the 8th month.
The respiratory system is fully functional in the baby by now, so there is no cause of alarm in case he pops out after seven months.
The baby's position will change in the tummy according to his physical, and mental development, and he will 
sleep more during this phase.
In the 7th month of pregnancy, the baby's weight is around 900-1000 grams or a little above a kilogram..
</p>
 <h4>Some Dos and Don'ts to Follow During the 7th Month of Pregnancy:-</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">As you approach your last trimester, you need to be extra cautious and vigilant about your diet and lifestyle. 
Here's a list of precautions that you need to follow during this time period:
</p>
 <h4>Dos:</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">-Go for frequent walks. Taking a break in between chores and going for short walks is good for your health. 
Avoid sitting in the same position for long hours. Keep your body active and flexible as much as possible.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">-Engage in a hobby. This will help you feel happy, relaxed and take your mind off unnecessary worries and thoughts. 
It can be anything like reading a book, watering plants, painting, or singing. It will help you stay calm and focused.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">-Practice meditation and breathing exercises. It will help your mind stay calm and relaxed. 
Invest 10-15 minutes every day practising different techniques of breathing, for example, 
controlled deep breathing, and shallow breathing, or breathing from the stomach, and breathing from the chest.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">-Regularly exercising throughout your pregnancy will keep you active and fit. 
It will also help you recover faster post-delivery. Practice basic stretches as recommended by your trainer, and doctor.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">-Consume iron-rich foods like eggs, fruits, cereals, leafy veggies, red meat, etc. 
along with vitamin C supplements. 
These foods are natural sources of iron, essential for your baby's health and yours too. 
The vitamin C supplements assist in quick absorption of iron from the foods. 
You can contact your doctor for the supplements and get them prescribed.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">-Monitor your haemoglobin levels closely through regular blood tests. 
Women who have the rhesus negative or Rh-negative blood type need to pay special attention to their blood reports 
to avoid complications during pregnancy and childbirth.
</p>
 <h4>Don'ts:</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">-The correct sleeping posture is extremely crucial for your body. 
Try to sleep on your left side as it optimizes blood circulation, 
and the supply of oxygen, and nutrients for you and your baby. 
It will also help your kidneys to function smoothly, and reduce swelling.</p>
 <p>-Quit smoking, and alcohol consumption completely. 
Also ensure that you are not in the company of smokers, as passive smoking is harmful.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">-During the 7th month, you will not be able to bend; try not to slouch, and maintain a correct posture at all times.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">-Avoid lifting heavy objects. You need to delegate the responsibility of carrying heavy stuff to your family for a few months.
</p>
<h4>Foods to Eat During the 7th Month of Pregnancy:-</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">->In the 7th month of pregnancy, diet is very important, 
and it is essential that you follow the instructions of your doctor carefully. 
This is the time when your baby develops his cognitive and visual functions, 
so it is important that you consume omega 3 fatty acids. These fatty acids will enhance the growth process in the baby. 
Fish, eggs, and seafood are a few rich sources of omega 3 fatty acids.</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">->Consume fruits and veggies rich in vitamin C and iron. 
Iron intake is extremely important at this point in time. 
You can include spinach, meat, eggs, green leafy veggies, etc. that contain natural sources of iron.</p>

  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Eighth Month</h5>
        <h4>8th Month of Pregnancy - Symptoms, Bodily Changes & Diet:-</h4>
        <h5>8 Months Pregnant – Symptoms:-</h5>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">The eighth month of pregnancy is not easy. 
There will be significant changes in a pregnant woman's body during this time as well. 
Some typical symptoms that mark the beginning phase of the third trimester are as follows.
</p>
        <h4>1. Shortness of Breath</h4>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">The growing baby and the consequently growing baby bump will add up a few extra kgs to your body. 
Internally, the expansion of the uterus starts putting pressure on the lungs and compresses it. 
These bodily changes can cause breathlessness. This condition improves when the baby positions himself 
in the cephalic position during this month.
</p>
        <h4>2. False Contractions</h4>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">You are likely to experience false contractions during this month. 
False contractions are also known as Braxton Hicks contractions, that resemble the real labour time contractions. 
They usually last for a few seconds only. This is a natural step the body takes towards preparing the uterine muscles for delivery. 
However, less water intake during this time can trigger false contractions even more.
</p>
        <h4>3. Constipation</h4>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">Constipation is a common problem during pregnancy and it can start as early as the first month of pregnancy. 
But constipation will trouble you even more in the third trimester of your pregnancy. 
As the growing uterus constricts the space available for the bowels and other internal organs in the pelvic region, 
you may likely experience difficulty in bowel movement during this month. If you put excess pressure while passing stools,
 you may also notice some blood in the stool. This condition is easily treatable with a laxative, so, consult your doctor 
if you experience constipation.
</p>
        <h4>4. Back Pain</h4>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">The increasing baby weight and tummy will put pressure on the lumbar region of the back. 
It may also change the centre of gravity. Consequently, many women, during this phase experience back pain,
especially after long hours of sitting or standing. If you experience back pain, 
you can correct your posture by practising some simple pregnancy-safe exercises or by using a pregnancy pillow.
</p>
        <h4>Physical Changes in the Eighth Month of Pregnancy-</h4>
        <p>The eight month of pregnancy is the time when your baby will gain significant weight and grow quite rapidly. 
This will directly bring about a number of changes in your body. You may start noticing some of the following 
changes during this time.</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">->Your baby bump will obviously grow bigger.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">->Around this time, urinary incontinence may kick in. 
A small amount of urine leakage may happen every time you sneeze, cough, or even laugh. 
It can be quite embarrassing and annoying. Consult your doctor if it interferes too much with your day to day life. 
Also, practice Kegel exercise to tighten the bladder muscles.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">->Heartburn, especially during the night can give you sleepless nights. 
Try home remedies or consult your doctor for simple and safe medication for heartburn.
Water retention and swelling of extremities are common during the third trimester.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">->Leakage of the amniotic fluid may happen from the vagina for some women. 
It can be differentiated from urine based on the stronger smell and texture of the fluid. 
However, if the amniotic fluid leaks, you must consult with your doctor immediately.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">->Breathlessness and dizziness can occur due to the growing baby bump.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">->Watch out for false contractions, also called the Braxton-Hicks contractions that occur during the third trimester. 
These are not the real contractions that occur during the delivery but may feel similar. 
Braxton-Hicks contractions may last for about 30 seconds to a few minutes. However, 
you should consult your doctor if they last longer or you experience pain.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">->Your breasts may also start leaking around this time. The first breast milk which is called colostrum may leak from your breasts.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">->Hot flashes occur for some women during the third trimester.
</p>

</p>
 <h4>Do's</h4>
 <h4>Eat Healthy Food</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">You are in the eighth month of your pregnancy and you must be eating healthy foods already. 
But this is just a reminder to encourage you to keep going. Have a balanced diet and have small meals but frequently.

</p>
 <h4>Exercise</h4>

</p>
 <h4>Stay Hydrated</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">Remind yourself to drink lots of water regularly to keep your body hydrated.

</p>
<h4>Get Enough Vitamin D</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Vitamin D is very important for the bone health of your baby and for you as well. 
So bask in the sun in the morning hours or in the evening.
</p>
 <h4>Don'ts</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">->Don't eat processed food or junk food. Eating junk food can lead to indigestion and even heartburn.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">->Don't forget to take your vitamin and mineral supplements.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">->Avoid practising yoga poses or exercises without consulting a doctor or a trained instructor.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">->Don't stress yourself with the thought of delivery and labour. You can cross the bridge once you reach there.
Worrying much ahead of time will affect your health unnecessarily.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">->Don’t drink or smoke during this period and avoid aerated drinks and caffeine too.
</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">->Avoid stressing because it won't make things better for you. 
Slowly take a back seat from any stressful works as it is likely to affect your baby's health.
</p>
 <h4>Diet</h4>
 <p style="text-align:justify;">As with every month of pregnancy, even the 8th month of pregnancy diet needs to be balanced. 
Include fibrous foods in your diet to overcome the problem of constipation that is likely to hit you this month again. 
Eating foods rich in Omega-3 fatty acids or supplements at this stage is also necessary as it will aid your 
baby’s brain development. It is better to avoid raw, uncooked food, raw shellfish, processed food, 
coffee and unpasteurised milk at this stage to prevent food poisoning or allergic reaction.</p>

especially during the final trimester, due to the fear of preterm delivery or injury to the foetus. 
However, research clearly shows that exercise is actually beneficial for delivery, reducing any potential 
complications and making it comfortable and less difficult. Exercising in the ninth month of pregnancy is certainly 
possible with some minor changes in terms of style and body positioning to allow for the changes in your physical structure, 
as well as the needs of the foetus.
